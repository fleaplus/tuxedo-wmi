E06BDE62-EE75-48F4-A583-B23E69ABFB91 is unknown to the kernel, a driver may need
to be implemented for this GUID.
A WMI driver probably needs to be written for this WMI event. It can checked for
using: wmi_has_guid("E06BDE62-EE75-48F4-A583-B23E69ABFB91"). One can install a
notify handler using
wmi_install_notify_handler("E06BDE62-EE75-48F4-A583-B23E69ABFB91", handler,
NULL). http://lwn.net/Articles/391230 describes how to write an appropriate
driver.
